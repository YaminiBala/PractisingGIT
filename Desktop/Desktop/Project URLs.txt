B, Yamini (Contractor) 1:20 PM
Hi Apurva
I have one doubt in CVR 
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 1:21 PM
hi Yamini
B, Yamini (Contractor) 1:21 PM
For XH-secure or 350 , by default cvr count is going as 1
cvreligibleis 1
Exctly -when we process with tracking code "10400138" , by default cvr count is 1 for demi services
Is it so?
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 1:23 PM
the count depends on the services you have in the request
it is not fixed for any scenario
B, Yamini (Contractor) 1:25 PM
but req does not contain cvr product number which is 10400463 , it has only 10096 and 10400138 by the time Iam getting cvr count is 1. Is it correct?
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 1:25 PM
what is the getAccount response
?
B, Yamini (Contractor) 1:26 PM
Install flow so account not found
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 1:26 PM
pls ping the account details
B, Yamini (Contractor) 1:27 PM
ok

B, Yamini (Contractor) 1:39 PM
Hi
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 1:39 PM
Hi
B, Yamini (Contractor) 1:39 PM
expected behaviour?
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 1:40 PM
checkgin Yamini
some alerts in production
checking that right now
B, Yamini (Contractor) 1:41 PM
or we should not get cvr count as 1 for xh-secure when we are not sending cvr product number?
ok
B, Yamini (Contractor) 2:19 PM
hI
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 2:25 PM
Hi
we are checking Yamini
B, Yamini (Contractor) 2:26 PM
ok..
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 2:28 PM
Yamini, that is because 10400138 is configured in UI in XHS-Product Numbers for CVR
meaning if this product is configured and we get in request, it will consider it as CVR product
and hence sending the count as 1
B, Yamini (Contractor) 2:31 PM
ok. Is this expected bahaviour?
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 2:31 PM
yes
if you remove 10400138  from that UI config , it will not send the cvr count as 1
B, Yamini (Contractor) 2:33 PM
ok. I will be sending mail please reply on top of it
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 2:33 PM
sure
B, Yamini (Contractor) 3:21 PM
Any updates for ,y mail?
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 3:21 PM
i have replied, right
B, Yamini (Contractor) 3:21 PM
on top of it . i sent one more
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 3:22 PM
was there any question in it ?
B, Yamini (Contractor) 3:22 PM
We configured  “10400138”  in UI for 150 service. If we remove we won’t get CVR for 150 by default.
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 3:23 PM
yes correct,
that is what I mentioned in my mail too
that is fine, right
B, Yamini (Contractor) 3:24 PM
can u reply on top of it?
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 3:26 PM
but there is no need ,right
why to have unnecessary mails
what i have written in my previous mail, is what you have asked in your mail
B, Yamini (Contractor) 3:39 PM
According to your logic for 150 we should get 2 cvr count , but we are getting one .
because we configured both 10300029 and 10400138 
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 3:40 PM
no not necesarry
pls share that account
because for previous account i think you used 10096
right
1 is expected
by default, we always send 1
you can check one thing
apart from default, keep one CVR product in request
that time it should give count = 2
B, Yamini (Contractor) 3:44 PM
no. first I processed 10096 and 10400138 by the time count came as 1 since we conf tracking code . if this is logic, for 150 cvr count should come as 2 rgt bec we conf both 10300029 and 10400138.
Padhya, Apurva (Contractor) 3:45 PM
no, even in case of configuring both  10300029 and 10400138, we we should get 1 as a default, because that is not part of incrementing logic
apart from these 2 , if you have any specific CVR rate code, then it should give count as 2
you can try that
have 10300029 and 10400138 .. and one CVR product
that should give you 2
B, Yamini (Contractor) 3:46 PM
ok
